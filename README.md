Review of neuron networks class material from IBM data science

## Jupiter notebook files ##
#### Images processing ####
##### 1.0_load_and_display_data.ipynb ##### 
- Initial dataset from simple images using IO, PIL, matplotlib and pandas.
##### 2.1_data_loader_PyTorch.ipynb ##### 
- Prepare the dataset by creating folders for each type of target categorized for AI-supervised learning with sample sizes and ratios.
- Supervised training, sample datasets, and labels we can do by configuration file or folder name, and the folder name is managed easily.
- 👧💬 In TensorFlow ImageDataSet Generator support configuration file and folder name, simply generate indexes of objects and labels and you can specific number of record or random its output continue until the end there is a dataset class object inheritance.

##### Custom dataset #####
👧💬 The same as in Python - TensorFlow / Tensorflow-lite, PyTorch - Tensorflow / Tensorflow-lite

```
class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    """custom dataset."""

    def __init__(self, index_filename):
        ...

    def __len__(self):
        ...

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        ...

    🧸💬 Possible working with internal function for validation or random numbers.
    def __Thee_axis_alignement__(self, dX, dY, dZ):
        ...
```

##### 2.1.2_Images_with_python_library_CV.ipynb ##### 
- Images concatenation, file string attribute manipulation, important image property size, identities, and dimension, image plotting and negative image, image label system conversion using CV2, save and read images using CV2, colour label conversion grey scales, colour scales, negative colour, RGBA, RGB, *RGBY system. Image plot and sub-images plot, indexing and image cropping, image array values copy for parallel process images system, image colour channels and CV2 image colour system conversion sample BGR_to_RGB.
- 🐑💬 In printing we need to convert RGBA to RGBY because of information in Y channel, converted back to RGBA is not the same think about Y channel is arrays of information.
- 🦭💬 Someone experiments on RGBY images the same as PDF and information beware of misused he passed but teacher pattern about the image standard is RGB or RGBA.

    ret, frame = vid.read()
    
    if ( ret ):
        
        frame = cv2.cvtColor( frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB )  
        
        o_image = tf.image.flip_up_down( frame )
        o_image = tf.keras.utils.array_to_img( o_image )
        o_image = tf.image.resize( o_image, [64, 64] )
        o_image = tf.cast( o_image, dtype=tf.int32 )
        
        image = filters( o_image )
        
        fig.axes[1].clear()
        plt.axis( 'off' )
        
        coords = find_image_countour( image )

        image = Image.open( img_buf )
        im.set_array( image )

    return im
```


##### 2.2.1_basic_image_manipulation_PIL.ipynb ##### 
- Introduce Python array management library Numpy, copy image array for new identity of same value for parallel images processing, object Id value and references, working with images as an array, image array properties, using Numpy array function to working with image sample flip and ImageOps from PIL, image array cropping using Numpy and Python array fundamental and value update, PIL image draw with fill colour function, * image font from PIL ImageFont, image overlay with cropped image.

##### PIL ImageOps rotation for image.transpose() function #####
🧸💬 It is Enumurator number mapping of functions and you can find some usages such as cv2.THRESH_OTSU + cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV that depends on the mode number they are setting.
[Jump to](https://github.com/jkaewprateep/Neuron-Networks-review/blob/main/README.md#ops-codes)

```
flip = {
         "FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT": Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT,
         "FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM": Image.FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM,
         "ROTATE_90": Image.ROTATE_90,
         "ROTATE_180": Image.ROTATE_180,
         "ROTATE_270": Image.ROTATE_270,
         "TRANSPOSE": Image.TRANSPOSE, 
         "TRANSVERSE": Image.TRANSVERSE
        }
```

##### 2.2.2_basic_image_manipulation_open_CV.ipynb ##### 
- Image variable and image id reference 🐑💬 There is no need to copy the entire array because the image is a dataset of array you can use Id references, PIL images important properties, CV2 with image rotate and flip functions, CV2 crop image, CV2 draw a rectangular inside image and CV2 putText, cv2 image flip.

```
flip = {
         "ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE":cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE,
         "ROTATE_90_COUNTERCLOCKWISE":cv2.ROTATE_90_COUNTERCLOCKWISE,
         "ROTATE_180":cv2.ROTATE_180
       }
```


##### 2.3.2_Histogram_and_Intensity_Transformations.ipynb ##### 
- Numpy arrays management library, matplotlib plot, subplot, histogram of image and arrays, bar chart, greyscale, histogram sequence calculation from cv2.calcHist.
- 🐑💬 Image identification by intensity distribution you need to select correct channel or ranges, image input scales from [0, 1] to [0, 255] or *[-255, 255], CV rectangular draw, image brightness and fundamental.
- 🐐💬 Another tip for image identification is image scales, linear scales, or images with channel concatenation.
- 🐑💬 Linear modulo image for medical investigation, contrast adjustment.
- 🧸💬 We do not compare the image's intensity amplitudes but the pattern or we can transform them into the frequency domain using a short-time furrier transform. Histogram equalization.
- 🐑💬 It is a matrixes linear scales method. Thresholding and simple segmentation by response range of image input representing, transform image from its scales to another scales by conditions or domain variance.
- 🦭💬 I revealed to you some of the mathematics discovered images in the computer we are using most of them are arrays of linear scales and when differentiated the linear variables value that is not changing over time or domain will be removed resulting in something moving on the screen. We can have edge detection but saved of the calculation process we consider moving objects as our eyes and senses.

##### Alpha beta ranges array for image pixel contrast #####
🐑💬 In linear scales tangent line indicates how much of the target values different can be added or subtracted to maintain the meaning thresholds Y = mx + C.
```
new_image = cv2.convertScaleAbs(goldhill, alpha=alpha, beta=beta)
```

##### Image binary ratios #####
- 🐑💬 cv2.THRESH_BINARY is the original idea to reduce the number of different inputs for the compression method and restore by intensity scales on the client.
- 🧸💬 cv2.THRESH_TRUNC is the enchant matrixes of no-meaning pixels.
- 🐐💬 cv2.THRESH_OTSU is to solve the problem about unfairs selected representing matrix.
- 👧💬 🎈 cv2.THRESH_BINARY is a direct conversion when presenting pixels matrix in specific ranges of ratios present in one value and reverse as a binary image.
- 👧💬 🎈 cv2.THRESH_TRUNC find a presenting value of pixels matrix with neighbors and re-scales.
- 👧💬 🎈 cv2.THRESH_OTSU combined both methods to solve the unfairs selection presenter matrix.  
```
cv2.THRESH_BINARY
cv2.THRESH_TRUNC
cv2.THRESH_OTSU
```

##### 2.4.1_Gemetric_trasfroms_PIL.ipynb ##### 
- PIL image rescales image rotation, image as array number identification, image greyscales, singular value decomposition.
- 🐑💬 It is the decomposing of the image into diagonal and vector images, it has the same properties as images for identity identification and process if you are using the correct design and you can combine them after operation. This way to prevent you from having original images but you still can process them. Regeneration of different scale images for information.
- 🐐💬 We can apply this algorithm to multiple layers of image.
- 🦭💬 The equation is to reduce the form of the matrix using similarity using the Eigant value and Eigant vector, decomposed of images arrays when preserved of their property.
```
U, s, V = np.linalg.svd(im_gray , full_matrices=True)
```

##### 2.4.2_Gemetric_trasfroms_OpenCV.ipynb ##### 
- CV2.resize image resize using CV2, image translation, cv2.getRotationMatrix2D image rotation, image colour label transformation cv2.cvtColor(new_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB), noise image generation, singular value decomposition or linear alignment decomposition.
- 👧💬 Select correct ratios noise is supposed to be random and not aligned with the image linear ratios.
- 🦭💬 For fast computation Eigant vector is a vector representing of image and the Eigant value is similarity, The Eigant value can reduce form and can perform calculations as the original same as image fast track change.

##### Image resizing interpolation method #####
- source is image input.
- dsize is the target dimension.
- fx is the scale factor of horizontal pixels.
- fy is the scale factor of vertical pixels.
- interpolation is target interpolation method.
```
cv2.resize(toy_image, None, fx=2, fy=1, interpolation = cv2.INTER_NEAREST )

cv2.INTER_AREA: Area corresponding method.
cv2.INTER_CUBIC: Matrix corresponding method.
cv2.INTER_LINEAR: Linear scale manipulation method. This is the default interpolation technique in OpenCV.
```

##### Image translation #####
- 🐑💬 Translation image by image shifted or image phase, image phase translation is required when you need to compare two graphs of their alignment.
- 🦭💬 For linear comparison we do not need to have graphs collide but similarity and significant values. 🎛🎚🌐   
```
tx = 100
ty = 0
M = np.float32([[1, 0, tx], [0, 1, ty]])
new_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, M, (cols, rows))
```

##### 2.5.1_Spatial_Filtering-PIL.ipynb ##### 
- Linear filtering PIL ImageFilter, Gaussian blur ImageFilter.GaussianBlur, or ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(n_size), image sharpening ImageFilter.SHARPEN, Ridge or edge detection ImageFilter.EDGE_ENHANCE and ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES, and ImageFilter.MedianFilter.

##### Create custom image filters #####
🐑💬 The same as stride matrix or manipulation matrix in image convolution layers.
```
# Create a kernel which is a 5 by 5 array where each value is 1/36
kernel = np.ones((5,5))/36
# Create a ImageFilter Kernel by providing the kernel size and a flattened kernel
kernel_filter = ImageFilter.Kernel((5,5), kernel.flatten())
```

##### Image sharpen custom filters #####
Ref[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)

##### Common Kernel for image sharpening, ImageFilter.SHARPEN #####
```
kernel = np.array([[-1,-1,-1], 
                   [-1, 9,-1],
                   [-1,-1,-1]])
kernel = ImageFilter.Kernel((3,3), kernel.flatten())
```

##### Ridge or edge detection, ImageFilter.EDGE_ENHANCE and ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES #####
```
kernel = np.array([[ 0,-1, 0], 
                   [-1, 4,-1],
                   [ 0,-1, 0]])
kernel = ImageFilter.Kernel((3,3), kernel.flatten())

or

kernel = np.array([[-1,-1,-1], 
                   [-1, 8,-1],
                   [-1,-1,-1]])
kernel = ImageFilter.Kernel((3,3), kernel.flatten())
```

🐑💬 Another way is to use median filters for edge selection.
```
ImageFilter.MedianFilter
```

##### 2.5.2_Spatial_Filtering.ipynb ##### 
- Linear Filtering, Filtering Noise, Gaussian Blur, and removal.
- 🐑💬 This is used in printing technology. Image Sharpening, Edges, Sobel, Linear scales conversion cv2.convertScaleAbs, Sum derivative image cv2.addWeighted(abs_grad_x, 0.5, abs_grad_y, 0.5, 0)
- 🐑💬 Image depth enchantment method. Image median blur cv2.medianBlur and thereshold function parameter cv2.threshold. 

##### Linear Filtering #####
```
# Create a kernel which is a 6 by 6 array where each value is 1/36
kernel = np.ones((6,6))/36

# Filters the images using the kernel
image_filtered = cv2.filter2D(src=noisy_image, ddepth=-1, kernel=kernel)
```

##### GaussianBlur #####
```
image_filtered = cv2.GaussianBlur(noisy_image,(5,5),sigmaX=4,sigmaY=4)
```

##### Sobel function #####
🐑💬 Derivative of image in X or Y direction, both X and Y derivative is complexed.
```
ddepth = cv2.CV_16S
# Applys the filter on the image in the X direction
grad_x = cv2.Sobel(src=img_gray, ddepth=ddepth, dx=1, dy=0, ksize=3)
```

##### Threshold Function Parameters #####
🐑💬 For fairs selected and meaning pixels.
```
# Returns ret which is the threshold used and outs which is the image
ret, outs = cv2.threshold(src = image, thresh = 0, maxval = 255, type = cv2.THRESH_OTSU + cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
```

#### Basics Nuerons Networks methodology ####
* DL0101EN-1-1-Forward-Propgation-py-v1.0.ipynb

### Neurons Networks recaps ###
- 🐑💬 A single-layer perception is simply a response as reflection, observing a metal plate that shrinks or expands when heats distribution but not a knee knot hammer.
- 👧💬 🎈 Radius Basics is a single complex network that seems like redundancy work such as electrical switches or water tap control.
- 🧸💬 Multi-layer perception and recurrent networks are famous networks because many experiments published and they can be explained by non-complex features. There are many types and various of the number of layers and nodes when recurrent networks have multiple logical gates to select.
- 🐑💬 This is a known type of network that is AND OR networks logic or XOR logic we are using in electrical instruments such as current observing or pass-through logic for input from digits panels.
- 🧸💬 Multi-perception networks can simulate logical gates but they require training or similar networks for the same function this is one weakness they are improved by LSTM recurrent networks that can learn with logical gate pre-build.
- 🐐💬 Hopped fields or stars networks had working nodes as ring networks and in one of the node failures they copied the same function for the most appropriate selected number of nodes target.
- 🦭💬 Bolzedmann machines, select one side of the network it can calculate of multiple works in the same time. The equivalent of microscopics create work output on another side.

### Linear behavior of neurons networks node ###
🐑💬 Nueron networks are supposed to be complex and vary by multiple variables but the calculation will be too difficult and we cannot prove of its results behavior. For larger networks, we simulate each node's present value of node bias and weight Y = mx + C. This method allowed us to calculate the entropy network value at one edge of the network, from action to network until reaching one edge of the network presents a label or target function as a result. You can initial value of the weight and bias or use pre-trained values that are built with the commercial logic board and electronics path. Arduino and many logic boards make training easier and they build in pre-trained networks if you select the correct path and method.  
```
import numpy as np # import Numpy library to generate 

weights = np.around(np.random.uniform(size=6), decimals=2) # initialize the weights
biases = np.around(np.random.uniform(size=3), decimals=2) # initialize the biases
```
